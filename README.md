Project Overview

This project focuses on building a data architecture tailored to analyze and manage online interactions and customer sentiment for Ru9, leveraging insights from previous campaign data. The dashboard integrates three core datasets: mentions and sentiment data, demographic data, and interaction data. These datasets provide a holistic view of user engagement, enabling Ru9 to optimize its brand communication and customer satisfaction efforts. Below is a detailed breakdown:

Relevance to Ru9’s Management:
- Reputation Management: Sentiment analysis enables proactive issue resolution to protect and enhance Ru9’s brand image, especially on platforms with high interaction but mixed feedback. This ensures Ru9 stays ahead of potential crises while fostering a positive perception of the brand.
- Customer Engagement: Understanding engagement metrics helps Ru9 design campaigns like minigames, giveaways, or interactive content to drive higher participation and brand affinity. Tracking metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and click-through rates enables Ru9 to identify the type of content that resonates best with its audience.
- Market Insights: Social Listening identifies recurring customer concerns (e.g., product quality, delivery time, or customer service issues) to guide product improvements and refine marketing strategies. By analyzing customer preferences and trends, Ru9 can tailor its product offerings to meet market demands effectively.
- Campaign Optimization: Performance tracking allows Ru9 to evaluate the success of marketing campaigns in real time. By leveraging insights from social media discussions, Ru9 can optimize advertising spend, refine targeting, and adjust messaging to maximize reach and effectiveness.
- Competitor Benchmarking: Analyzing competitors’ online performance provides valuable insights into industry trends and customer expectations. Ru9 can identify gaps in competitors' strategies to position its brand as a superior choice in the mattress industry.
- Product Development: Feedback extracted from social platforms helps identify emerging needs and preferences, allowing Ru9 to innovate and launch products that align with customer expectations, such as new mattress designs, improved materials, or enhanced customer service solutions.
